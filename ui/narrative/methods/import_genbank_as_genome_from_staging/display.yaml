parameters :
    staging_file_subdir_path :
        ui-name : |
            GenBank File Path
        short-hint : |
            File with genome sequence in GenBank format or zip-file with GenBank files.
        long-hint  : |
            File with genome sequence in GenBank format or zip-file with GenBank files.

    genome_name :
        ui-name : |
            Genome Object Name
        short-hint : |
            Provide a name for the Genome that will be created by this importer
        long-hint  : |
            Provide a name for the Genome that will be created by this importer

    source :
        ui-name : |
            Source Of The GenBank File
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for the source of the data (If Ensembl the "gene" feature types will use the "gene" field as the id, otherwise the "locus_tag" field is used.)
        long-hint : |
            Provide name for the source of the data (If Ensembl the "gene" feature types will use the "gene" field as the id, otherwise the "locus_tag" field is used.)

    release :
        ui-name : |
            Release Or Version Of The Source Data
        short-hint : |
            Release or Version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)
        long-hint : |
            Release or Version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)

    genetic_code :
        ui-name : |
            Genetic Code For The Organism
        short-hint : |
            Valid genetic code (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)
        long-hint : |
            Valid genetic code integer for translation purposes(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)

    generate_ids_if_needed :
        ui-name : |
            Generate Feature Ids If Needed
        short-hint : |
            Generate feature ids if the fields normally used are not present
        long-hint : |
            Generate feature ids if the fields normally used are not present. 
            For gene features the locus_tag field is used (except for Ensmebl source, then gene field is used).
            For CDS features the protein_id field is used.
            Autogenerated ids will have the format of gene_1 or CDS_3 

    exclude_ontologies :
        ui-name : |
            Exclude Ontologies
        short-hint : |
            Do not include ontologies in the Genome object. This saves space.
        long-hint : |
            Do not include ontologies in the Genome object. There is a 1GB size limit.
            Ontologies tend to take up quite a bit of space.  If you have a large genome
            or do not care about ontologies you should consider excluding ontologies, assuming the source file had them.
